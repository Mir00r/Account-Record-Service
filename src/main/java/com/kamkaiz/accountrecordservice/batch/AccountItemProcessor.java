/**
 * A Spring Batch processor component that handles the processing of Account records during batch operations.
 * This class implements Spring Batch's ItemProcessor interface to process Account objects
 * before they are written to the database.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Processes each Account object individually during batch processing
 * - Performs validation and transformation of Account data if needed
 * - Logs processing activities for monitoring and debugging
 * - Can filter out accounts by returning null (current implementation passes through)
 *
 * The processor is part of the Spring Batch chunk processing chain:
 * Reader -> Processor -> Writer
 *
 * @see org.springframework.batch.item.ItemProcessor
 * @see com.kamkaiz.accountrecordservice.model.Account
