/**
 * A Spring Batch processor component that handles the processing of AccountTransaction records.
 * This class implements Spring Batch's ItemProcessor interface to process AccountTransaction objects
 * before they are written to the database.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Processes each AccountTransaction object individually during batch processing
 * - Validates and transforms transaction data if needed
 * - Can filter out invalid transactions by returning null
 * - Part of the transaction processing pipeline
 *
 * The processor is part of the Spring Batch chunk processing chain:
 * Reader -> Processor -> Writer
 *
